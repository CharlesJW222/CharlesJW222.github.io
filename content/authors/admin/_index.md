Hello! I’m Jinwei Hu (胡津玮), currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool under the supervision of Prof. Xiaowei Huang and Dr. Yi Dong. My research focuses on understanding and improving the robustness, interpretability, and reliability of modern AI systems, particularly in safety-critical settings. I am especially interested in LLM-driven agents operating in dynamic or adversarial environments, the emergence of collusive behaviours among autonomous agents, and fine-grained knowledge manipulation techniques such as LLM unlearning. I also work on simulation-driven cyber defence, multi-agent coordination, and the integration of symbolic structure with generative intelligence.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed an MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering with Distinction at Imperial College London, where I conducted research on AI4Science and explainable AI under the supervision of Dr. Sibo Cheng and Dr. Rossella Arcucci from the Data Science Institute.I also hold a First Class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from the University of Liverpool and BSc in Information and Computing Science from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

📚 My current research interests include but not limited to:

- Generative AI
- Responsible AI
- Agentic AI
- AI Safety and Security
- AI4Science
  
Please reach out to collaborate 😃
